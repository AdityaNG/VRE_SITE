# VRE App

<img src="docs/img/drive.png?raw=true" width=400>

The idea is to have one common place where we can view all of VRE's Drive Links and Purchases.
Also being able to see a timeline is helpful to keep the entire team on one page.
Right now we share drive links over WhatsApp and it becomes a little tedious. The app gives a common place to put and search for all URLs related to VRE.
As of now, Purchases are not relevant as we aren't really buying too many things, I expect this to become more of a utility as time progresses.

# What it does :

The app gives you access to 3 things

1. Timeline
2. Drive Links
3. Purchases

The Timeline is a list of deadlines with a title, short description and an optional link associated with it.
The link might refer to a document / drive folder with relevant information about that deadline.
If a link is added to a deadline, it automatically gets added to the drive links section of the app.

The Drive Links section is a list of URLs with associated titles. The links do not need to actually point to Google Drive, any links are allowed.

The Purchases section will be the place where we will list all our purchases along with product image, bill, price, person who purchased, how much VRE owes that person, etc.

There is also a bug report section which allows you to report any issues or features that you would like to see in the future
All of the above support a comment section for each individual post and search bar.

# How to install :

Since it is a web app, you may install it as a Web App or use it on your web browser.
To install the app on desktop, press the install button on the search bar on Chrome.
To install the app on Android, press the “Add to home screen” button in the 3-dot menu on Chrome.

# Rollout Plan : 

The idea is to have all MODs install the app initially for a week and see all the issues that arise.
Once those issues are ironed out and the app seems stable, the whole team can start using the app.

# Known issues :

1. The app does not auto update, you need to manually clean browser's cache for the website.
2. Chrome is best supported. Other browsers have not been tested
3. Notifications on the app are not always consistent; some notifications get dropped
